            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Nigella. I am a food-geek as well as chef at Food-Network. During the beginning of my culinary
                career, I was preoccupied with running my kitchens and the classical cuisine of France. I later
                experienced the cuisines of Italy and the Mediterranean. I didn’t really view the cuisine of Brazil as
                something that I could use in my profession at the time. As I got better as a cook and as a chef, I saw
                ways that I could incorporate the flavor combinations and profiles of Brazilian cuisine into the
                techniques that I was using to create a style of cookery that had yet to be utilized. My food, the food
                of my soul, started to take shape and led me in a direction that I hadn’t been before as a culinarian.
